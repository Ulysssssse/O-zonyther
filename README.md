//how it look like ?\\
It look like an giant underground cave (more than 200 block high) with big stalactites, with many biomes, oceans, structures, villages with 2 new type of
villager (dark and normal angel with wings) the ambiance is very dark and apocalyptic, with fog everywhere, and other immersive things, such as bushes, 

small flowers, fish, trees, large caves, more or less modern cities sometimes made of wood or harder materials, biome snow, or fire and much more to 

discover, giant sky island.
The story takes place in an apocalyptic world, in the Jurassic era, where the inhabitants who are angels developed truly magical and incredible 

technology, while being terrifying, they knew how to build big cities, hunt the 
great predator, but technology has taken over and the world has perished, it's up to you to fight corruption and multiple bosses to save it.....or not, 

but you'll have tried.
From the modern to the jurrasic, passing by the middle age, everything is mixed in.
You will see some big mushrooms, giand tree, sky island, giant tower temple
The ambience of the world mixes a lot of things, the middle land, a lot of biome, pure adventure, the ice biome, which plunges you into the cold, the 

dark forest biome which gives you the chills with their wild moose.
The dark atmosphere of the world will make you want to explore the smallest corners of the dimension.
